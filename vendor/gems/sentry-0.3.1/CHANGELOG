*0.2.1* (9 Jul 2005)

* vastly simplified one_way_encrypt at danp's suggestion.  Use this in your model to try it out:

  That generates an SHA hash of model.password to model.crypted_password which is saved in the DB.  
  model.password is a virtual field.  Continue using validates_confirmation_of for confirmation.
