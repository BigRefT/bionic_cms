== Creating the test database

The default name for the test databases is "sentry_plugin_test". If you 
want to use another database name then be sure to update the connection 
adapter setups you want to test with in test/database.yml. 

Make sure that you create database objects with the same user that you specified in i
database.yml otherwise (on Postgres, at least) tests for default values will fail.

== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs
the entire test suite for the sqlite adapter. You can also run the suite on just
one adapter by passing the DB environment variable.

  rake test DB=mysql

For more information, checkout the full array of rake tasks with "rake -T"

Rake can be found at http://rake.rubyforge.org

== Running by hand

Unit tests are located in test directory. If you only want to run a single test suite, 
or don't want to bother with Rake, you can do so with something like:

  cd test; DB=mysql ruby base_test.rb
   
That'll run the base suite using the MySQL adapter. Change the adapter
and test suite name as needed.

== Faster tests

If you are using a database that supports transactions, you can set the
"AR_TX_FIXTURES" environment variable to "yes" to use transactional fixtures.
This gives a very large speed boost. With rake:

  rake AR_TX_FIXTURES=yes

Or, by hand:

  AR_TX_FIXTURES=yes ruby -I connections/native_sqlite3 base_test.rb
